# Introduction
##### SysReview - A systematic review web application

SysReview is a Systematic Review Application. The purpose of this application is to enable researchers to perform a systematic review using PubMed. A systematic review consists of a number of stages, which need to be recorded:  Query Construction, Abstract Pool Evaluation and then Document Pool Evaluation. The API to use is provided by E-Utilities which gives access to the [PubMed API.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/api.shtml "PubMed API")

<div id='Motivation'/>
## Motivation

This application was created for the University of Glasgow Computing Science Web App Development course. 

<div id='Installation'/>
## Installation

 1. Open a terminal and navigate to your workspace
 2. Clone repository by using command: ``` git clone https://github.com/Alistair401/10C.git ```
 3. We would recommend creating a virtual directory at this stage and ``` workon <virtualenv> ```
 4. Set up your virtual environment using the [requirements.txt](../master/requirements.txt) using the command: ```  pip install -r requirements.txt ```
 5. To deploy the app locally navigate to the SysReview directory then run the command: ```python manage.py runserver```
 6. To launch the SysReview application open a web browser and go to: ```http://localhost:8000/```

<div id='Populate SysReview'/>
## Populate SysReview

You can use the SysReview application and create your own data or you can populate the database with our test data by running the [populate_sysreview.py](../master/SysReview/populate_sysreview.py) file.

The population script will create 3 users with passwords set to their username, each user will have 3 reviews and 2 oof each users reviews will have querys created.

##### Populate instructions

1. In your terminal navigate to the sysreview directory
2. Run the command: ``` python populate_sysreview.py ```
3. The script should run and display a message followed by ```Starting SysReview population script...```
